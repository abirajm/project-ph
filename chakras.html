        <p>The word chakra is an ancient Sanskrit word meaning \93wheel\94 or \93vortex.\94
                Chakras are part of the human energy system. There are seven main chakras that run from the base of the spine to the top of the head. 
                These chakras are said to resemble a funnel that becomes wider as it gets farther away from the body.
                 Each chakra vibrates to a specific tone and color.
                A healthy balanced chakra will spin in an even circular motion. 
                A highly functioning chakra is presented as feeling whole, content, vitalized and healthy in our bodies.
                 Conversely, a weakened, unbalanced chakra will present in the body as a lack of energy, restlessness, depression and feeling disconnected or \93out of sorts.\94
                Our chakras are affected by our daily life. For example, a positive experience such as a warm hug from a loved one will affect the state of chakras positively.
                 In this case, perhaps the heart and sacral chakras will be filled with beneficial energy and spin evenly, causing the person to feel love or happiness as a result of the hug.
                The same can be said for negative experiences. Depending on the experience, one or more of the chakras can be disrupted and cause a feeling of dis-ease or unpleasantness in the body.
                The seven main chakras correspond to the endocrine glandular system of the human body.  
                Our endocrine system is responsible for regulating hormones in the body. 
                The hormones that are produced contribute to our overall health and well being.
                Some of the most vital processes in our bodies are controlled by our hormone regulations. 
                For example, the way we age, our growth, reproductive systems, metabolism, stress reactions and our ability to heal are all connected with the hormones secreted by the endocrine system.
                The chakras align with the seven main endocrine glands.
                 During a Reiki treatment the physical body (endocrine glands) and the energetic body (the chakras) are filled with Chi or life force energy to create balance.
