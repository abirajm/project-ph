It holistic approach touches all aspect of life i.e physical,mental, emotional, psychological and spiritual.

Reiki is discovered by Dr. Mikao Usui in 1922. Usui Mikao ( in Japanese) was the founder of a form of spiritual practice known as Reiki, used as a complementary therapy for the treatment of physical, emotional, and mental diseases. According to the inscription on his memorial stone, Usui taught Reiki to over 2000 people during his lifetime. Sixteen of these students continued their training to reach the Shinpiden level, a level equivalent to the Western third degree, or Master level.

                Q.3 Is it a substitute of medication or conventional medical care ?
                
                 No, this is not a substitute of medication or conventional medical care. You will be advised to see a doctor or physician for proper medical attention to the problem. This is the compliment with the medical care.
                
                Q.4 How does it work ? Does it work on Faith ?
                
                It doesn\92t work on faith. If you say to yourself that it is not going to work. Then also, it will work. You just need to open your mind in receiving mode. It works on your energy system and works on the root cause of the problem. The practitioner will place different hand position on the client\92s body or slightly above the body in the energy field. Scan the aura and energy field to check the area of concern. Reiki will flow through practitioner\92s hands into the body or energy field of the client.
                
                Q.5  Is it Religious ? Is it mandatory to be a spiritual person or religious ?
                
                This is not religious at all. This is purely spiritual by nature. Any person from any country, place, religion, caste can learn and take reiki sessions without any discrimination.
                
                Q.6 What is a session ? Is it similar to massage session ?
                
                The session is in the soothing and quite environment at the swastika healing center with a soft music . The treatment is given through hands of the practitioner to the client. The client will be told to lie down on the massage table fully clothed. The practitioner uses different hand positions at different locations on the client\92s body with or without gentle touch. Reiki flows smoothly from the practitioner\92s hands into the client\92s body and energy field.
                
                Q.7 How long the session goes ?
                
                 The session goes for an hour and 15 min. Before and after the session will be the time to fill the form and information on the area of concern. If you have any questions or concerns you are free to ask and tell before and after the session.

                Q.9 How many sessions do I need to solve my problem ?
                
                 Most of the traumas are released in one session . But still , it depends on the layers of the cause of an issue. Sometimes, it takes 3 or more than 3 sessions to get good results. But in the very first session, the client feels relaxed , peaceful and full of vital energy.
                
                Q.10 What is the difference between hands-on healing and Distance healing ?
                
                Hand-on healing is the session with the therapist in the Reiki Center for an hour. Distance healing is slightly different from hands- on healing as this is the session in which therapist fixes time of the client and sits with his picture and send him reiki in the meditative state. After the distance healing, you will be notified by the mail about the session details.

                Q.15 If I give Reiki to anyone/client, will it affect my own health ?
                
                 Many people think that it will affect their health if they give healing to the people who are suffering from pain. or they think that they are going to take their Karma on them. This is not true with reiki. As this is coming directly from God or Spiritual energy , your personal energies are not involved or used for healing a person. Everything is done by Reiki \96 the universal energy.
