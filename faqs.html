        <p>Q.1 What is Reiki ?</p>
        <p>
                Reiki is a Japanese art of stress reduction and relaxation which also promotes healing. This is simple yet powerful technique of inviting happiness. It holistic approach touches all aspect of life i.e physical,mental, emotional, psychological and spiritual. It comes from 2 Japanese Kanjis i.e Rei-Key; which means Spiritual energy helps non-physical energy in infinite ways. For more details, you can check reiki page. Reiki is discovered by Dr. Mikao Usui in 1922. Usui Mikao ( in Japanese) was the founder of a form of spiritual practice known as Reiki, used as a complementary therapy for the treatment of physical, emotional, and mental diseases. According to the inscription on his memorial stone, Usui taught Reiki to over 2000 people during his lifetime. Sixteen of these students continued their training to reach the Shinpiden level, a level equivalent to the Western third degree, or Master level. Usui died on 9 March 1926 of a stroke.

                  Mentally and psychologically : it reduces insomnia , anxiety, depression , stress etc.

                Spiritually : it connects the person to the higher-self and awakens our divine powers. It helps the person to grow spiritually and make him clairvoyance. It balances chakras(vital energy points in our body) and heal aura.

        <p>        Q.3 Is it a substitute of medication or conventional medical care ?</p>
        <p>No, this is not a substitute of medication or conventional medical care. You will be advised to see a doctor or physician for proper medical attention to the problem. This is the compliment with the medical care.
        </p>        
        <p>        Q.4 How does it work ? Does it work on Faith ?</p>
                
        <p>It doesn't work on faith. If you say to yourself that it is not going to work. Then also, it will work. You just need to open your mind in receiving mode. It works on your energy system and works on the root cause of the problem. The practitioner will place different hand position on the client's body or slightly above the body in the energy field. Scan the aura and energy field to check the area of concern. Reiki will flow through practitioner's hands into the body or energy field of the client.

                The session is in the soothing and quite environment at the swastika healing center with a soft music . The treatment is given through hands of the practitioner to the client. The client will be told to lie down on the massage table fully clothed. The practitioner uses different hand positions at different locations on the client's body with or without gentle touch. Reiki flows smoothly from the practitioner's hands into the client's body and energy field.

        </p>        
        <p>         Most of the traumas are released in one session . But still , it depends on the layers of the cause of an issue. Sometimes, it takes 3 or more than 3 sessions to get good results. But in the very first session, the client feels relaxed , peaceful and full of vital energy.

        <p>        Q.10 What is the difference between hands-on healing and Distance healing ?
        </p>       
        <p>        Hand-on healing is the session with the therapist in the Reiki Center for an hour. Distance healing is slightly different from hands- on healing as this is the session in which therapist fixes time of the client and sits with his picture and send him reiki in the meditative state. After the distance healing, you will be notified by the mail about the session details.

        <p>        Q.15 If I give Reiki to anyone/client, will it affect my own health ?
        </p>       
        <p>         Many people think that it will affect their health if they give healing to the people who are suffering from pain. or they think that they are going to take their Karma on them. This is not true with reiki. As this is coming directly from God or Spiritual energy , your personal energies are not involved or used for healing a person. Everything is done by Reiki \96 the universal energy.
