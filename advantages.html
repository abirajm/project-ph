                    Reiki Helps Reduce Stress and Promotes Relaxation <strong> Reducing stress is a big concern in our society.</strong>
            </br>   It is important to live a life free from the debilitating effects of stress, although it is not possible to live without stress.
                    Reiki helps to trigger the relaxation response and thereby reduce stress. 
                    You feel more relaxed, regardless of what is going on in your life or with your health. 
                    Cutting excess stress from your life is very beneficial for a number of reasons, including to help prevent heart problems, prevent stomach problems, and deal with mood disorders. 
                    Reiki is a recognized way to treat stress and its associated problems.

                    Reiki Helps Treat Depression and Anxiety
                    The Reiki treatment improves your mood, which improves symptoms of anxiety and depression. 
                    The anxiety and depression lessen as the mood improves. 
                    And your energy and spirit increases as the positive energy begins to flow. 
                    Many people use Reiki as a treatment for depression and anxiety, either alone or alongside conventional medicine treatments.

                    Reiki Improves Focus and Control
                    Reiki benefits the mind and the entire life by providing a sense of control and groundedness that connects you to the present moment. 
                    As you focus on the present moment you learn to accept events as they happen and work with the situation to improve on it, rather than acting out of habit.

                    Reiki Improves Joint Mobility
                    Experts are not really sure how Reiki works to improve the range of motion in a joint. 
                    But it seems that Reiki is just as effective as physical therapy in improving this outcome. 
                    Many people believe that Reiki works by altering the muscle structure of the joint which improves pain levels and movement.
