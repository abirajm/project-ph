    <title>What is REIKI</title>
</head>
    <body>
        <p>Reiki (pronounced "ray-key") is a hands-on Japanese energy healing technique for stress reduction and relaxation .
                That also promotes healing of mind, body, and spirit. 
                Reiki is based on the understanding that humans and all living things have a universal life force energy that flows through them. 
                Pain and disease result when this energy is low or blocked by physical, emotional, or spiritual distress. 
                Reiki is administered by a gentle "laying on of the hands."
                 Reiki practitioners place their hands on or slightly above a client or from distance and act as a funnel or straw for this life energy. 
                The reiki removes energy blocks and balances the person's energy system. 
                This promotes the body's self-healing ability and provides a sense of peace and well-being.
